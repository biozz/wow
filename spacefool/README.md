# Spacefool

**⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is not complete and will not work out of the box. It's an experimental implementation of the traditional Russian card game Durak.**

## What is Spacefool?

Spacefool is an experimental multiplayer implementation of **Durak** (Дурак), a traditional Russian card game where players compete to get rid of all their cards. The last player remaining with cards becomes the "Fool" (Дурак).

## Technical Approach

This implementation explores using SpacetimeDB as a game backend with a Nuxt.js frontend, providing real-time multiplayer synchronization and persistent game state.

The project serves as an experiment in building real-time multiplayer games with modern web technologies and decentralized database concepts.
